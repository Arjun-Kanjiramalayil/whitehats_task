I would love to join the White Hats because I have been interested in coding and cybersecurity field of technology also. Im still a beginner, but I join in the belief that I would be able to learn a lot of new things after joining the club. Im pretty well-versed in code logic, I just have to get comfortable with the code syntaxes, and how they work in real life applications.
I have heard recently that there has been a data leak at Harvard, personal info of many students, teachers, and graduates were stolen and leaked online.
